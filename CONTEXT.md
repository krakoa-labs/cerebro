# Cerebro

Cerebro is an open-source CLI that scans React/TypeScript design systems and produces deterministic indicators describing their inventory, internal quality, and history. The indicators are intended to feed a future web dashboard and to help design system teams make informed decisions about adoption, migration, and maintenance.

## Language

**Design system**:
A React/TypeScript codebase that exposes a curated set of reusable UI components, tokens, and patterns for consumption by other applications.
_Avoid_: Component library (overlaps but is narrower)

**Scan**:
A single, deterministic analysis run of a design system that produces a complete set of indicators.
_Avoid_: Crawl, parse, inspect

**Indicator**:
A deterministic value produced by a scan — for example an inventory count or an internal quality measure — derived purely from static analysis and git history.
_Avoid_: Metric (implies telemetry or runtime sampling), measurement, stat

**Fixture**:
A minimal fake design system kept under `fixtures/` whose sole purpose is to exercise a specific shape Cerebro must handle. Each fixture is paired with at least one test that asserts the expected indicators.
_Avoid_: Example (implies user-facing demo), sample, test data

**DS developer**:
Persona who maintains the design system and uses Cerebro to understand its state and evolution day-to-day.

**Lead DS**:
Persona who owns the design system strategy and uses Cerebro indicators to make decisions about scope, migration, and adoption across consuming applications.

## Relationships

- A **Scan** operates on a **Design system** and produces a set of **Indicators**
- A **Fixture** is a minimal **Design system** used to validate Cerebro scans in tests
- A **DS developer** runs **Scans**; a **Lead DS** consumes the **Indicators** they produce

## Example dialogue

> **Lead DS:** "What do you mean by **indicator** — is that the same as a metric we'd see on a dashboard?"
> **Dev:** "An **indicator** is the deterministic output of a **scan** — for example 'Button is exported from three locations in this **design system**'. It's derived from static analysis and git history, so the same codebase always produces the same indicators. That's the whole point: no telemetry, no runtime sampling."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "metric" was initially used interchangeably with **Indicator** — resolved: indicators are deterministic snapshots from static analysis, not telemetry. The project deliberately avoids "metric" to preserve this distinction.
